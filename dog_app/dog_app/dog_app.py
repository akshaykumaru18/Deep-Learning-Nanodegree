# In this notebook, some template code has already been provided for you, and you will need to implement additional functionality to successfully complete this project. You will not need to modify the included code beyond what is requested. Sections that begin with **'(IMPLEMENTATION)'** in the header indicate that the following block of code will require additional functionality which you must provide. Instructions will be provided for each section, and the specifics of the implementation are marked in the code block with a 'TODO' statement. Please be sure to read the instructions carefully! 
# 
# > **Note**: Once you have completed all of the code implementations, you need to finalize your work by exporting the Jupyter Notebook as an HTML document. Before exporting the notebook to html, all of the code cells need to have been run so that reviewers can see the final implementation and output. You can then export the notebook by using the menu above and navigating to **File -> Download as -> HTML (.html)**. Include the finished document along with this notebook as your submission.
# 
# In addition to implementing code, there will be questions that you must answer which relate to the project and your implementation. Each section where you will answer a question is preceded by a **'Question X'** header. Carefully read each question and provide thorough answers in the following text boxes that begin with **'Answer:'**. Your project submission will be evaluated based on your answers to each of the questions and the implementation you provide.

# ### Why We're Here 
# 
# In this notebook, you will make the first steps towards developing an algorithm that could be used as part of a mobile or web app.  At the end of this project, your code will accept any user-supplied image as input.  If a dog is detected in the image, it will provide an estimate of the dog's breed.  If a human is detected, it will provide an estimate of the dog breed that is most resembling.  The image below displays potential sample output of your finished project (... but we expect that each student's algorithm will behave differently!). 
# 
# ![Sample Dog Output](images/sample_dog_output.png)
# 
# In this real-world setting, you will need to piece together a series of models to perform different tasks; for instance, the algorithm that detects humans in an image will be different from the CNN that infers dog breed.  There are many points of possible failure, and no perfect algorithm exists.  Your imperfect solution will nonetheless create a fun user experience!

# ## Step 0: Import Datasets
# 
# Make sure that you've downloaded the required human and dog datasets:
# 
# **Note: if you are using the Udacity workspace, you *DO NOT* need to re-download these - they can be found in the `/data` folder as noted in the cell below.**
# 
# * Download the [dog dataset](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/dogImages.zip).  Unzip the folder and place it in this project's home directory, at the location `/dog_images`. 
# 
# * Download the [human dataset](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/lfw.zip).  Unzip the folder and place it in the home directory, at location `/lfw`.  
# 
# *Note: If you are using a Windows machine, you are encouraged to use [7zip](http://www.7-zip.org/) to extract the folder.*
# 
# In the code cell below, we save the file paths for both the human (LFW) dataset and dog dataset in the numpy arrays `human_files` and `dog_files`.

# In[1]:


import numpy as np
from glob import glob


import PIL.Image


# load filenames for human and dog images
human_files = np.array(glob("/data/lfw/*/*"))
dog_files = np.array(glob("/data/dog_images/*/*/*"))

# print number of images in each dataset
print('There are %d total human images.' % len(human_files))
print('There are %d total dog images.' % len(dog_files))


# <a id='step1'></a>
# ## Step 1: Detect Humans
# 
# In this section, we use OpenCV's implementation of [Haar feature-based cascade classifiers](http://docs.opencv.org/trunk/d7/d8b/tutorial_py_face_detection.html) to detect human faces in images.  
# 
# OpenCV provides many pre-trained face detectors, stored as XML files on [github](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/master/data/haarcascades).  We have downloaded one of these detectors and stored it in the `haarcascades` directory.  In the next code cell, we demonstrate how to use this detector to find human faces in a sample image.

# In[2]:


import cv2                
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt                        
get_ipython().run_line_magic('matplotlib', 'inline')

# extract pre-trained face detector
face_cascade = cv2.CascadeClassifier('haarcascades/haarcascade_frontalface_alt.xml')

# load color (BGR) image
img = cv2.imread(human_files[0])
# convert BGR image to grayscale
gray = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)

# find faces in image
faces = face_cascade.detectMultiScale(gray)

# print number of faces detected in the image
print('Number of faces detected:', len(faces))

# get bounding box for each detected face
for (x,y,w,h) in faces:
    # add bounding box to color image
    cv2.rectangle(img,(x,y),(x+w,y+h),(255,0,0),2)
    
# convert BGR image to RGB for plotting
cv_rgb = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)

# display the image, along with bounding box
plt.imshow(cv_rgb)
plt.show()


# Before using any of the face detectors, it is standard procedure to convert the images to grayscale.  The `detectMultiScale` function executes the classifier stored in `face_cascade` and takes the grayscale image as a parameter.  
# 
# In the above code, `faces` is a numpy array of detected faces, where each row corresponds to a detected face.  Each detected face is a 1D array with four entries that specifies the bounding box of the detected face.  The first two entries in the array (extracted in the above code as `x` and `y`) specify the horizontal and vertical positions of the top left corner of the bounding box.  The last two entries in the array (extracted here as `w` and `h`) specify the width and height of the box.
# 
# ### Write a Human Face Detector
# 
# We can use this procedure to write a function that returns `True` if a human face is detected in an image and `False` otherwise.  This function, aptly named `face_detector`, takes a string-valued file path to an image as input and appears in the code block below.

# In[114]:


# returns "True" if face is detected in image stored at img_path
def face_detector(img_path):
    img = cv2.imread(img_path)
    gray = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
    faces = face_cascade.detectMultiScale(gray)
    return len(faces) > 0


# ### (IMPLEMENTATION) Assess the Human Face Detector
# 
# __Question 1:__ Use the code cell below to test the performance of the `face_detector` function.  
# - What percentage of the first 100 images in `human_files` have a detected human face?  
# - What percentage of the first 100 images in `dog_files` have a detected human face? 
# 
# Ideally, we would like 100% of human images with a detected face and 0% of dog images with a detected face.  You will see that our algorithm falls short of this goal, but still gives acceptable performance.  We extract the file paths for the first 100 images from each of the datasets and store them in the numpy arrays `human_files_short` and `dog_files_short`.
# 
# __Answer:__ 
# Human Count :  98
# Dog Count :  17

# 

# In[4]:


from tqdm import tqdm

human_files_short = human_files[:100]
dog_files_short = dog_files[:100]

human_count = 0
dog_count = 0
#-#-# Do NOT modify the code above this line. #-#-#

## TODO: Test the performance of the face_detector algorithm 
## on the images in human_files_short and dog_files_short.
for i in human_files_short:
    if face_detector(i) == True:
        human_count += 1

    if face_detector(i) == True:
        dog_count += 1
        
        
print("Human Count : ", human_count)
print("Dog Count : ", dog_count)


# We suggest the face detector from OpenCV as a potential way to detect human images in your algorithm, but you are free to explore other approaches, especially approaches that make use of deep learning :).  Please use the code cell below to design and test your own face detection algorithm.  If you decide to pursue this _optional_ task, report performance on `human_files_short` and `dog_files_short`.

# ## Step 2: Detect Dogs
# 
# In this section, we use a [pre-trained model](http://pytorch.org/docs/master/torchvision/models.html) to detect dogs in images.  
# 
# ### Obtain Pre-trained VGG-16 Model
# 
# The code cell below downloads the VGG-16 model, along with weights that have been trained on [ImageNet](http://www.image-net.org/), a very large, very popular dataset used for image classification and other vision tasks.  ImageNet contains over 10 million URLs, each linking to an image containing an object from one of [1000 categories](https://gist.github.com/yrevar/942d3a0ac09ec9e5eb3a).  

# In[5]:


import torch
import torchvision.models as models
import PIL.Image

# define VGG16 model
VGG16 = models.vgg16(pretrained=True)

# check if CUDA is available
use_cuda = torch.cuda.is_available()

# move model to GPU if CUDA is available
if use_cuda:
    VGG16 = VGG16.cuda()


# In[7]:


use_cuda = torch.cuda.is_available()
use_cuda


# Given an image, this pre-trained VGG-16 model returns a prediction (derived from the 1000 possible categories in ImageNet) for the object that is contained in the image.

# ### (IMPLEMENTATION) Making Predictions with a Pre-trained Model
# 
# In the next code cell, you will write a function that accepts a path to an image (such as `'dogImages/train/001.Affenpinscher/Affenpinscher_00001.jpg'`) as input and returns the index corresponding to the ImageNet class that is predicted by the pre-trained VGG-16 model.  The output should always be an integer between 0 and 999, inclusive.
# 
# Before writing the function, make sure that you take the time to learn  how to appropriately pre-process tensors for pre-trained models in the [PyTorch documentation](http://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torchvision/models.html).

# In[124]:


from PIL import Image
import torchvision.transforms as transforms

    return preds # predicted class index

VGG16_predict(dog_files_short[0])


# ### (IMPLEMENTATION) Write a Dog Detector
# 
# While looking at the [dictionary](https://gist.github.com/yrevar/942d3a0ac09ec9e5eb3a), you will notice that the categories corresponding to dogs appear in an uninterrupted sequence and correspond to dictionary keys 151-268, inclusive, to include all categories from `'Chihuahua'` to `'Mexican hairless'`.  Thus, in order to check to see if an image is predicted to contain a dog by the pre-trained VGG-16 model, we need only check if the pre-trained model predicts an index between 151 and 268 (inclusive).
# 
# Use these ideas to complete the `dog_detector` function below, which returns `True` if a dog is detected in an image (and `False` if not).

# In[125]:


### returns "True" if a dog is detected in the image stored at img_path
def dog_detector(img_path):

# <a id='step3'></a>
# ## Step 3: Create a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (from Scratch)
# 
# Now that we have functions for detecting humans and dogs in images, we need a way to predict breed from images.  In this step, you will create a CNN that classifies dog breeds.  You must create your CNN _from scratch_ (so, you can't use transfer learning _yet_!), and you must attain a test accuracy of at least 10%.  In Step 4 of this notebook, you will have the opportunity to use transfer learning to create a CNN that attains greatly improved accuracy.
# 
# We mention that the task of assigning breed to dogs from images is considered exceptionally challenging.  To see why, consider that *even a human* would have trouble distinguishing between a Brittany and a Welsh Springer Spaniel.  
# 
# Brittany | Welsh Springer Spaniel
# - | - 
# <img src="images/Brittany_02625.jpg" width="100"> | <img src="images/Welsh_springer_spaniel_08203.jpg" width="200">
# 
# It is not difficult to find other dog breed pairs with minimal inter-class variation (for instance, Curly-Coated Retrievers and American Water Spaniels).  
# 
# Curly-Coated Retriever | American Water Spaniel
# - | -
# <img src="images/Curly-coated_retriever_03896.jpg" width="200"> | <img src="images/American_water_spaniel_00648.jpg" width="200">
# 
# 
# Likewise, recall that labradors come in yellow, chocolate, and black.  Your vision-based algorithm will have to conquer this high intra-class variation to determine how to classify all of these different shades as the same breed.  
# 
# Yellow Labrador | Chocolate Labrador | Black Labrador
# - | -
# <img src="images/Labrador_retriever_06457.jpg" width="150"> | <img src="images/Labrador_retriever_06455.jpg" width="240"> | <img src="images/Labrador_retriever_06449.jpg" width="220">
# 
# We also mention that random chance presents an exceptionally low bar: setting aside the fact that the classes are slightly imabalanced, a random guess will provide a correct answer roughly 1 in 133 times, which corresponds to an accuracy of less than 1%.  
# 
# Remember that the practice is far ahead of the theory in deep learning.  Experiment with many different architectures, and trust your intuition.  And, of course, have fun!
# 
# ### (IMPLEMENTATION) Specify Data Loaders for the Dog Dataset
# 
# Use the code cell below to write three separate [data loaders](http://pytorch.org/docs/stable/data.html#torch.utils.data.DataLoader) for the training, validation, and test datasets of dog images (located at `dog_images/train`, `dog_images/valid`, and `dog_images/test`, respectively).  You may find [this documentation on custom datasets](http://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torchvision/datasets.html) to be a useful resource.  If you are interested in augmenting your training and/or validation data, check out the wide variety of [transforms](http://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torchvision/transforms.html?highlight=transform)!

# **Question 3:** Describe your chosen procedure for preprocessing the data.

# - Did you decide to augment the dataset?  If so, how (through translations, flips, rotations, etc)?  If not, why not?
# 

# **Answer**: I've applied RandomResizedCrop & RandomHorizontalFlip to just train_data. This will do both image augmentations and resizing jobs. Image augmentation will give randomness to the dataset so, it prevents overfitting and I can expect better performance of model when it's predicting toward test_data. On the other hand, I've done Resize of (256) and then, center crop to make 224 X 224. Since valid_data will be used for validation check, I will not do image augmentations. For the test_data, I've applied only image resizing.

# __Answer:__ (conv1): Conv2d(3, 32, kernel_size=(3, 3), stride=(2, 2), padding=(1, 1))
# 
# activation: relu
# 
# (pool): MaxPool2d(kernel_size=2, stride=2, padding=0, dilation=1, ceil_mode=False)
# 
# activation: relu
# 
# (conv2): Conv2d(32, 64, kernel_size=(3, 3), stride=(2, 2), padding=(1, 1))
# 
# activation: relu
# 
# (pool): MaxPool2d(kernel_size=2, stride=2, padding=0, dilation=1, ceil_mode=False)
# 
# (conv3): Conv2d(64, 128, kernel_size=(3, 3), stride=(1, 1), padding=(1, 1))
# 
# (pool): MaxPool2d(kernel_size=2, stride=2, padding=0, dilation=1, ceil_mode=False)
# 
# (dropout): Dropout(p=0.3)
# 
# (fc1): Linear(in_features=6272, out_features=500, bias=True)
# 
# (dropout): Dropout(p=0.3)
# 
# (fc2): Linear(in_features=500, out_features=133, bias=True)
# 
# **explanations :** First 2 conv layers I've applied kernel_size of 3 with stride 2, this will lead to downsize of input image by 2. after 2 conv layers, maxpooling with stride 2 is placed and this will lead to downsize of input image by 2. The 3rd conv layers is consist of kernel_size of 3 with stride 1, and this will not reduce input image. after final maxpooling with stride 2, the total output image size is downsized by factor of 32 and the depth will be 128. I've applied dropout of 0.3 in order to prevent overfitting. Fully-connected layer is placed and then, 2nd fully-connected layer is intended to produce final output_size which predicts classes of breeds.

# __Question 5:__ Outline the steps you took to get to your final CNN architecture and your reasoning at each step.  Describe why you think the architecture is suitable for the current problem.

# __Answer:__ 
# I picked ResNet as a transfer model because it performed outstanding on Image Classification. I looked into the structure and functions of ResNet. The core idea of ResNet is introducing a so-called “identity shortcut connection” that skips one or more layers. I guess this prevents overfitting when it's training.

# __Question 6:__ Is the output better than you expected :) ?  Or worse :( ?  Provide at least three possible points of improvement for your algorithm.

# __Answer:__ (Three possible points for improvement)
# 1. More image datasets of dogs will improve training models. Also, more image augmentations trials (flipping vertically, move      left or right, etc.) will improve performance on test data.
# 2. Hyper-parameter tunings: weight initializings, learning rates, drop-outs, batch_sizes, and optimizers will be helpful to        improve performances.
# 3. Ensembles of models
